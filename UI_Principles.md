UI/UX Review & Direction — OnePan
🧭 1. Strategic Design Direction
Core UX Philosophy

OnePan should feel as simple as the meals it represents.
Your design should communicate:

Simplicity: one-pan meals → one-glance clarity.

Confidence: clean layout, clear steps, no clutter or guesswork.

Warmth: friendly, visual, food-forward aesthetic that feels human, not technical.

Think of it as a blend of "Apple Health minimalism" + "Pinterest food warmth".

Core Design Pillars
Pillar	Meaning	Design Implication
Clarity	Users should always know what’s next.	One primary CTA per screen, high contrast for action buttons.
Comfort	The app is used mid-cook.	Big fonts, big buttons, forgiving spacing.
Visual Cues	Reduce reading.	Use icons, photos, and ingredient thumbnails wherever possible.
Speed	No unnecessary steps.	3–5 seconds to complete each action.
🎨 2. Visual Direction
Color Palette

Base: Warm neutrals — off-white (#FAF6F3), light beige (#F7EDE2).

Accents: Muted orange (#E27D60), olive green (#8D8741), or terracotta (#D9A679).

Text: Charcoal (#2F2F2F).

Feedback states: Soft green for “ready,” light red for “missing,” gentle yellow for “substitution.”
→ This evokes warmth and food without heavy saturation.

Typography

Headers: Rounded sans-serif (e.g., Nunito, Poppins, Manrope).

Body: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter).

Large size, 16–18pt body text minimum, 24–28pt headers.

Iconography

Line icons with soft rounded edges.

Use meaningful mini-icons (🧄 garlic, 🍅 tomato, 🫕 pan silhouette) instead of generic placeholders.

Ingredient icons should be playful but consistent — avoid mixed art styles.

Imagery

High-quality recipe images (natural light, top-down view).

Each recipe card should feel like a micro “poster” — not crowded with text.
